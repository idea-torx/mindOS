# IdeatorX Autopilot Control Plane v1

Durable local coordination layer for Hermes, Client Manager, Momentum Manager, cron jobs, and explicitly requested Claude Code work.

## Safety boundary

This v1 is a registry and evidence layer. It does **not** deploy, merge, send external messages, submit applications, or run arbitrary agent commands.

## Commands

```bash
A=~/.hermes/autopilot/autopilot.py
python3 "$A" init
python3 "$A" create --project Trove --title "Example task" --priority P1 --next-action "Inspect evidence"
python3 "$A" list
python3 "$A" claim <task-id> --owner hermes --minutes 30
python3 "$A" heartbeat <task-id> --owner hermes --note "Running verification"
python3 "$A" receipt <task-id> --kind verification --payload '{"tests":"pass","health":200}'
python3 "$A" update <task-id> --status waiting_for_user --next-action "Leo review"
python3 "$A" dashboard
```

## Task lifecycle

```text
queued → claimed → running → waiting_for_user → completed
                         ↘ waiting_for_review
                         ↘ blocked
```

Terminal states are `completed`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

## Receipts

Receipts are stored in `receipts/` and indexed in SQLite. A completed engineering task should carry evidence such as:

- test/typecheck result
- commit SHA
- PR URL
- CI result
- deployment URL
- health-check result
- approval record

## Next integration

The hourly control tower should read this registry and report task changes. Existing project-specific policies should be added under `policies/` before allowing automatic side effects.
